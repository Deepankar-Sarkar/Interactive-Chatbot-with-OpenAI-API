## üõ†Ô∏è DEVELOPMENT OF AI CHATBOT USING OPENAI API  
  
AI chatbots are fast changing the way organisations communicate with their
customers, and two well-known technologies for building them are Node.js and React. Node.js, a cross-platform open-source JavaScript runtime environment, provides a versatile and efficient backend approach for constructing chatbots. React, a JavaScript package for creating user interfaces, offers a strong front-end framework for creating conversational interfaces. Developers may create AI avatars that can comprehend and reply to user questions, make personalised recommendations, and even do complex
tasks like booking appointments or ordering things by combining various technologies. The OpenAI API provides powerful tools for developing intelligent avatars that can
recognise complicated language patterns and reply with personalised, relevant information. Developers can use the OpenAI API to construct avatars that can answer a client enquiries, make product predictions, and even assist with complex activities like booking trips. React also provides a unified user experience through fluid animations, dynamic updates, and a live conversation interactions. Overall, developing an AI avatars with Node.js and React can assist organisations in improving customer engagement and streamlining operations, while also providing an intelligent and interactive solution to fulfil their customers' expectations. In addition to interacting with users effectively and providing logical answers to their questions, our avatar will also include a module to assist users with their wellness, giving our product a more sophisticated, human touch.

## üìñ Overview  

This project demonstrates how to leverage the OpenAI API to create an AI-powered chatbot. The chatbot can engage in meaningful conversations, answer queries, and perform tasks defined by its configuration.  

It provides a hands-on approach to help you:  
- Understand how to use the OpenAI API.  
- Set up a Node.js development environment.  
- Create a chat interface and integrate it with the OpenAI API for real-time conversations.  
- Customize the chatbot to enhance its usability for various scenarios.

## üöÄ Installation  

Navigate to the Project Directory:
cd Chat-gpt-ai-tool  

- Install Dependencies:
```npm install  ```

- Set Up Environment Variables:
Create a .env file in the project‚Äôs root directory and add the following line:
```OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here ``` 

- Start the Server:
```npm start ``` 

## üí° Usage
- **Launch the Application:**
After starting the server, open a browser and visit ``` http://localhost:3000.```

- **Interact with the Chatbot:**
Type a query in the input box.
The bot will generate a response based on the OpenAI GPT model.

- **Test Advanced Features:**
Experiment with the bot by asking creative or technical questions to test its capabilities.

## üîß Customization
**Modify Bot Behavior:**
Adjust the OpenAI API parameters in the app.js file:
- Temperature: Controls the randomness of responses.
- Max Tokens: Limits the response length.
- Top P: Balances response diversity.

**Customize the Interface:**
Edit the CSS files to change the chatbot's appearance, including color schemes, fonts, and layout.

**Add New Functionalities:**
Extend the chatbot‚Äôs capabilities by integrating APIs or adding custom logic.

## üèóÔ∏è Application Architecture
- **Front-End:**
The user interface is a simple HTML/CSS/JavaScript setup for interaction.

- **Back-End:**
Node.js and Express handle API requests and responses.

- **API Integration:**
The app communicates with OpenAI's API to fetch and render responses.

- **Environment Variables:**
API keys and sensitive configurations are securely stored in a 
```.env file.```

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting
**API Key Issues:**
- Ensure your API key is valid and correctly stored in the .env file.

**Error: "429 Too Many Requests":** 
- This indicates you‚Äôve exceeded OpenAI‚Äôs rate limits. Upgrade your plan if necessary.

**Server Not Starting:**
- Check if Node.js is installed and all dependencies are properly installed using npm install.

**Incorrect Responses:**
- Adjust the API parameters to fine-tune the chatbot's behavior.
